# stol

`stol` is a suite of tools that make it easy to create and manage git
worktrees. It uses reflinks to make worktree creation fast and cheap even on
huge monorepos.

In order to use `stol`, you need a Linux filesystem that supports reflinks. The root filesystem in most Linux installations does not support reflinks, so most users will have to create a new fileystem in order to use `stol`.

There are two ways to provide one.

* As a disk image: create a large file on your existing disk, format it as XFS,
  and mount it. `stol create-image` sets this up.
* As a dedicated disk: format a spare physical disk as XFS and mount it. `stol
  format-drive` sets this up.

`stol` contains helpers for both options.

Although `stol` has only been tested on XFS, it may be possible to use other filesystems like btrfs.

## Install

### Dependencies

Building `stol` requires `liburing`, a C compiler, and make

```sh
sudo apt install liburing-dev gcc make
```

At runtime stol uses:
- `git`: required
- `xfsprogs`: required for most users. supports `stol create-image` and `stol format-drive`
- `sgdisk`: required only for `stol format-drive`
- `gh`:  optional, supports worktree creation by github PR URL

```
sudo apt install git xfsprogs gdisk
```

`gh` can be installed following [these instructions](https://cli.github.com/).

### Installing

Install stol to a location on your `PATH`:

```sh
make install
```

This builds and installs all executables to `~/.local/bin`. You may override the install location with `PREFIX`.

```sh
make install PREFIX=/usr/local
```

Be sure to follow the post-install instructions to finish setting up your environment.

## Setup

With stol installed, provision the reflink-capable filesystem it will use for
`$STOL_ROOT`. By convention we mount it at `/mnt/work`, but any location works as
long as your user owns the mount point.

First create the mount point:

```sh
sudo mkdir /mnt/work
sudo chown $USER:$USER /mnt/work
```

Then provision the filesystem with one of the helpers (see the two options
above) and mount it there:

- `stol create-image`: create and format a disk image
- `stol format-drive`: format a dedicated physical disk

`stol format-drive` must run as root. Be careful to use the correct disk in
this command, or you may lose data.

```sh
sudo "$(command -v stol-format-drive)" /dev/diskname
```

## Directory layout

`stol` prescribes a particular directory layout under `$STOL_ROOT`.

```
$STOL_ROOT/projects/<repository name>/<worktree name>
```

Each time you `stol import` a new repository, you get a new directory under `$STOL_ROOT` for that repo. That new directory contains each of its worktrees as subdirectories.

Your projects directory will look something like this:

```
/mnt/work/projects $ tree -L 2 -a
.
├── my-project.git
│   ├── .repo
│   ├── .stol
│   ├── 00-main
│   ├── task-1
│   ├── task-2
│   └── task-3
└── stol.git
    ├── .repo
    ├── .stol
    ├── 00-main
    └── feature-1
```

There are four kinds of directories under a project:

1. `.repo`: the main checkout of the repo. You should never have to think about
   this.
2. `00-{branchname}`: a "template" worktree. Most of the time you will have
   exactly one, with the main branch checked out.
3. `.stol`: a place for your repo-specific hooks.
4. The remaining directories are worktrees created by `stol new`.

When you import a project with `stol import`, it creates a `.repo` directory and
an initial "template" worktree.

When you create a new worktree with `stol new`, it makes a reflinked copy
of the template worktree. If you have multiple template worktrees,
`stol new` prompts you to select one.

In order to pick up the latest changes in your template worktree, you can run
`stol sync <project>`. It is also safe to run `git pull` yourself.

You can conveniently delete worktrees with `stol rm`. It takes several forms:

```sh
stol rm .                    # delete the current worktree
stol rm <worktree>           # delete a worktree by name in this project
stol rm <project>/<worktree> # delete a worktree by name in any project
```

## scd

`scd` is an interactive shell function that makes it quick and easy to jump
into a worktree, even if the target worktree does not yet exist.

Installation:

```sh
# bash users
source /path/to/stol.git/src/stol.bash

# zsh users
source /path/to/stol.git/src/stol.zsh

# fish users
source /path/to/stol.git/src/stol.fish
```

Usage:

```sh
scd                          # cd to the projects root
scd <project>                # cd to a project directory
scd <project>/<worktree>     # cd to a specific worktree
```

`scd` can create new worktrees implicitly:

```sh
scd -n <name> [<project>]    # create a new worktree (new branch)
scd -e <branch> [<project>]  # check out an existing branch in a new worktree
scd <pr-url>                 # check out a GitHub PR branch in a new worktree
```

With `-n` and `-e`, the project can be omitted if your working directory is
already in a project.

If the worktree already exists, `-e` and PR URLs will cd there without
recreating it.

The PR URL form is shorthand for `-e`. It resolves the branch name and project
from the URL via `gh`, so instead of:

```sh
scd -e someone/branch-name repo-name
```

you can do:

```sh
scd https://github.com/Applied-Intuition-Open-Source/stol/pull/1
```

## tui

`stol tui` is an interactive terminal UI for browsing and managing all your
worktrees. It shows a list of every project and worktree under `$STOL_ROOT`
on the left, and a detail pane on the right for the selected worktree: its
branch and upstream tracking state, last commit, dirty files, diff stat
against upstream, and the HEAD reflog.

```sh
stol tui          # or use the `stui` shell function to cd on selection
```

Because a TUI process cannot change your shell's directory, `stol tui` prints
the selected path on exit and nothing if you quit — the same contract as a
`fzf`-style picker. Use the wrapper function from `stol-tui.bash` to cd there
directly (add to your bashrc/zshrc):

```sh
# add to your shell config (bash and zsh both work):
source ~/.local/share/stol/stol-tui.bash
stui              # browse and cd into a worktree
```

Keys:

| Key   | Action                                                    |
| ----- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| `↑/↓` | move selection (also `j`/`k`, PgUp/PgDn, Home/End)        |
| `↵`   | exit and print the selected path (cd with `stui`)         |
| `s`   | open `$SHELL` in the selected worktree                    |
| `n`   | create a new worktree in the selected project             |
| `e`   | check out an existing branch in a new worktree            |
| `d`   | delete the selected worktree (uses `stol rm`, runs hooks) |
| `y`   | sync the selected project (`stol sync`)                   |
| `/`   | filter entries by name, branch, or project                |
| `t`   | toggle sorting by name / modification time                |
| space | collapse or expand the selected project                   |
| tab   | toggle the detail pane                                    |
| `r`   | refresh (re-scan worktrees and git state)                 |
| `?`   | help                                                      |
| `q`   | quit without changing directory                           |

`stol tui` has no dependencies beyond python3 (it uses the standard curses
module).

## Hooks

You can add hooks to customize stol commands by placing executables in
`.stol/hooks/` inside your project directory.

```
my-project/
├── .stol/
│   └── hooks/
│       ├── post-new
│       └── pre-remove
├── .repo/
└── 00-main/
```

- **post-new**: runs after the worktree is created, inside the new worktree
  directory.
- **pre-remove**: Runs inside the worktree directory, before it is deleted.

## Extending stol

You can add new stol subcommands by placing an executable prefixed with `stol-`
in your `PATH`. `stol my-subcmd` will call `stol-my-subcmd` internally.
